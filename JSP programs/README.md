Step 1: Create index.jsp – Input Form Page
This page contains a form with a text box to collect the user's name.
Step 2: Create welcome.jsp – Greeting Page
This page reads the name, stores it in the session, and displays a greeting.
It also sets the session timeout to 1 minute.
Step 3: Deploy and Test
Run the application on a server like Apache Tomcat.
Steps to test:
Go to index.jsp.
Enter your name and submit.
You'll see the greeting.
Wait for more than 1 minute without interacting.
Refresh the page — you’ll get a message that the session has expired.
